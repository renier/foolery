# Foolery

**A keyboard-first control room for multi-agent software work.**

Foolery helps you capture work, break it down, dispatch agents, review what they did, and keep the whole thing legible across repositories.

Foolery is a local orchestration app for agent-driven software work. It sits on top of memory-manager backends — primarily [Knots](https://github.com/acartine/knots), with [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) also supported — and gives you one place to stage work, run agents, and review outcomes across repos.

It is not trying to be just another chat box around a coding model. The point is to make multi-step work visible: what is queued, what is active, what is ready for review, and what happened in the session history.

## Install

### Prerequisites

You need:
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
- [curl](http://curl.se)
- [tar](http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/)
- at least one supported memory manager CLI:
  - [Knots](https://github.com/acartine/knots) (`kno`) — primary path
  - [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (`bd`)

### 1. Install Foolery

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acartine/foolery/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### 2. Make sure the launcher is on your PATH

If `~/.local/bin` is not already on your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### 3. Run setup

```bash
foolery setup
```

`foolery setup` helps you:
- discover repos
- detect available memory-manager backends
- scan for installed agent CLIs
- configure the app for first use

### 4. Start Foolery

```bash
foolery start
```

That launches the local server, opens the app in your browser, and leaves the backend running in the background.

## Supported Agent CLIs

Foolery launches and monitors agent sessions through their CLIs. It auto-detects installed agents and adapts its command invocation, output parsing, and terminal display per dialect.

| Agent | CLI Command | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | `claude` | Default dialect. Streams JSONL via `--output-format stream-json`. |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | `codex` | Uses `exec` subcommand with `--json` output. ChatGPT CLI variants also supported. |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) | `opencode` | Uses `run` subcommand with `--format json` output. |
| [Crush](https://github.com/charmbracelet/crush) | `crush` | Uses `run` subcommand with `-o stream-json` output. |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | `gemini` | Auto-detected and displayed in agent identity. |

Foolery scans your `$PATH` for these CLIs during setup and in **Settings > Agents**. You can register additional agent commands or override defaults there.

## Dispatch Modes

Foolery supports two dispatch modes for assigning agents to work, configurable under **Settings > Dispatch**.

### Simple (One agent per action)

Map one registered agent to each action type: **Take!** (execute a single beat), **Scene!** (multi-beat orchestration), and **Breakdown** (decompose work into sub-beats). If you want to change your default agent, the Swap Agent tool updates all matching mappings at once.

![Simple dispatch](docs/screenshots/dispatch-simple-20260314.png)

### Advanced (Weighted pools per step)

Assign weighted agent pools to each workflow step: Planning, Plan Review, Implementation, Implementation Review, Shipment, and Ship Review. Foolery picks from each pool according to the weights, which makes it useful for A/B testing models, mixing agent strengths, or spreading work across different tools. The Swap Agent tool still works across the whole dispatch configuration.

## Flow & Features

### Queues

The default view. All beats queued and ready for action — filter by type, priority, or free-text search. Select rows with spacebar, bulk-update fields, drill into inline summaries, and trigger agent sessions on any beat. Create new beats with Shift+N.

![Queues view](docs/screenshots/queues-20260314.png)

### Active

Beats currently in progress. See which agents are working, their model, version, and state at a glance. The Active view adds Agent, Model, and Version columns so you can monitor running work.

![Active view](docs/screenshots/active-20260314.png)

### Retakes

The review lane for shipped beats. Browse handoff capsules from agent sessions, inspect what changed, and trigger follow-up passes when something needs another look.

![Retakes view](docs/screenshots/retakes-20260314.png)

### History

A focused history feed for agent sessions. Browse recent beat activity, inspect beat metadata, and review app-to-agent and agent-to-app conversation logs in one timeline.

### Hot Keys

Need to stay in flow? Open the keyboard shortcut overlay (Shift+H) for a quick map of navigation, actions, editing, and panel controls across views.

## Why Foolery?

- **Keep software work legible.** See what is queued, running, ready for review, and already discussed.
- **Turn loose tasks into structured execution.** Break work into beats, stage dependency-aware waves, and run agents without losing the plot.
- **Review outcomes instead of trusting vibes.** Finished work lands in a review lane before it counts as done.
- **Stay fast without living in terminal tabs.** Navigate, select, bulk-update, and launch work from a keyboard-first interface.
- **Work across repos from one place.** Keep the orchestration layer above any single repository.
